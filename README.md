From Wikipedia:

	"The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions."

Therefore, we are creating an MD-10 like retrofit for the DC-10, however, it is more like a DC-10VIP, or a further developed version of the DC-10-30. It has similarities, but is not the same cockpit as the MD-10.  In addition to the flight deck upgrades, this variant of the MD-10 also has been given the MD-11's Pratt & Whitney PW4462 engines that produce 62,000 lbf (280 kN) thrust.  As such, with theoretical improvements to the aircraft's airframe to match the increased forces generated by the greater power of the engines allow the plane to fly both faster and higher.  The aircraft has also been given larger fuel tanks increasing its range to approximately 8000 nautical miles.  As such, it would likely in modern terms be classiifed as having an ETOPS in the range of no less than 180 and probably more likely 270.
