Thanks to Jabberwocky (Peter Brendt), Cain, Hooray, Philosopher, 5H1N0B1, Syd Adams, and others for their major contributions!

David Waggoner (DrDavid/Skyboat) and Peter Brendt (Jabberwocky/Jwocky) are collaborating on the project.

Project Description:

This project continues the development of the Boeing/McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30/MD-10 and its variants for FlightGear Flight Simulator.

We are in the process of upgrading the instrumentation of the flightdeck as well as improve the overall realism of the model.  The conversion also requires cleaning up code, fixing runtime errors, and incorrect links.

Generally, we're following the historical upgrades that Boeing/McDonnell-Douglas made to create the MD-10 out of the DC-10-30. From Wikipedia:

	"The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions."

Therefore, the MD-10 is included in the name of the project.

Ryan Miller, the DC-10-30's creator and developer, gave the aircraft a significant workover for the release FG 2.12.0, with excellent results! The changes we include in this version are envisioned out of those fixes and improvements.

As importantly, the DC-10-30 is equipped with the new Canvas-ready Navdisplay for the MFD, a major step forward in FlightGear's simulation sophistication and realism.

Initially, the project planned to find "off-the-shelf" instruments for a glass cockpit that could be fitted into the DC-10's flightdeck arrangement, not only by installing them in a format that would take into account panel design such as "the sacred six" but would work with the model's YAsim format.  Miller's CRJ700 provided the PFD and EICAS, along with other components such as the CDU, radios, side panels and upper panel.

The components for the Canvas-powered Navdisplay come from the new Mirage 2000 by 5H1N0B1.  

Having said this, the changes we are making to the DC-10-30/MD-10 are "cosmetic," though they are mostly functional and have a pretty good look to them. We have a TODO List needing to be implemented to "complete" this refit to the MD-10, with an eye toward making the DC-10-30/MD-10 among the very best aircraft in the FlightGear Hanger. That will be Phase 2, 3, etc.

Thanks to Phil Efstahiou for the great "Orbis Flying Eye Hospital" livery!
