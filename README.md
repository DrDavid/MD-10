From Wikipedia:

	"The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions."

Therefore, we are creating an MD-10 like retrofit for the DC-10, however, it is more like a DC-10VIP, or a further developed version of the DC-10-30. It has similarities, but is not the same cockpit as the MD-10.

Thanks to Phil Efstahiou for the great "Orbis Flying Eye Hospital" livery!
